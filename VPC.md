SUBNET:
> splitting of network, to ensure only specific teams/users can access a particular set of network address, to ensure data security.
> Adv: security, privacy, isolation

- private || public

> when we create vpc, we request for ip addresses
> subnet has CIDR range, that shows how many ip add available in a particular subnet.
CIDR range >>> any vpc ip add / 24
- /24 -> 256, /28 -> 16, /16 -> 2^16
> you can refer to CIDR calculators.
